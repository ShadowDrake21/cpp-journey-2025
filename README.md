# ðŸš€ My C++ Learning Journey

Hi, I'm Dmytro ðŸ‘‹  
I'm a software engineer currently based in Poland.  
After completing my studies in Software Engineering (with honors), I've decided to focus on **C++** â€” to deeply understand how systems, memory, and performance work.

This repository will document my progress as I learn, experiment, and build projects in C++ and Linux.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Build a solid foundation in modern C++ (C++11â€“C++20)
- Understand memory management, pointers, and data structures
- Practice system programming on Linux (files, processes, threads)
- Learn to use tools like `g++`, `cmake`, `gdb`, and `valgrind`
- Develop 2â€“3 small but complete C++ projects by March 2026

## ðŸ§± Current Setup

- **System:** Ubuntu 24.04 (moved from HDD â†’ SSD ðŸ’ª)
- **Editor:** VS Code + C/C++ extensions
- **Compiler:** g++ (GCC)
- **Other tools:** Git, CMake, GDB, Valgrind
